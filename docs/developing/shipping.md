# Shipping

Part of [DEVELOPING.md](../../DEVELOPING.md): the Debian packages, CI and releases.

## Packages and units

`packaging/` holds the nfpm configurations, the systemd units and the maintainer scripts
(reload systemd after install and removal, stop the agent before removal).

- `clowderd` depends on Debian packages and on `drbd-dkms` and `drbd-utils` from LINBIT's
  public repository; the host's APT sources must list it. `coccinelle` lets the DKMS build
  run offline.
- `clowderd.service`: `Type=notify` with a watchdog, `Restart=always` without a start limit,
  `KillMode=process` (helpers finish their step; containers belong to dockerd). The package
  installs it without enabling it; `clowderd init` enables and starts it.
- `clowder-tasks.slice`: memory limit for the agent's short-lived tasks.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `bin/dev lint`, `bin/dev test`, `bin/dev test-sops`,
`bin/dev test-tools` and `bin/dev package` on every push and pull request and keeps `dist/`
as an artifact. `test-tools` checks the renderers' golden files with Debian's `nft -c`,
`drbdadm` and `docker-compose` (`test/tools/check-golden-files.sh`). The live tests need
`/dev/kvm` and stay manual.

## Releases

A tag `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` starts `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

1. `bin/dev all` (lint, test, test-sops, test-tools, package); the version comes from the tag.
2. CLI archives for Linux, macOS (`.tar.gz`) and Windows (`.zip`).
3. `packaging/apt/publish.sh` adds the Debian packages to the public APT repository
   `webcodingcat/clowder-apt` with reprepro and signs it; GitHub Pages serves it at
   `https://webcodingcat.github.io/clowder-apt` (distribution `trixie`, component `main`,
   public key `clowder.asc`). Its `README.md` shows how a host adds it.
4. A GitHub release with the packages and the archives. It comes last: a version is out once
   it is in the APT repository. If only this step fails, create the release by hand
   (`gh release create`); re-running the workflow would publish the version again.

The workflow needs two secrets in this repository:

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `APT_SIGNING_KEY` | ASCII-armored private OpenPGP key without passphrase that signs the APT repository |
| `APT_DEPLOY_KEY` | private SSH key; its public half is a deploy key with write access on `webcodingcat/clowder-apt` |

`publish.sh` imports the key into a throw-away keyring and publishes the public half as
`clowder.asc`; `conf/` and `db/` stay in the APT repository so the next release adds to it.
